## Pre-flight checks

1. Verify on `main` branch.
2. Verify the working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes).
3. Read `package.json` to get the current version.
4. Confirm the new version is different from the current version.

If any check fails, report it and stop.

- Show the user the changelog diff and ask for confirmation before continuing.

### 4. Commit

- Stage: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Commit message: `Release v<new-version>`
- Do NOT use `--no-verify`.

### 5. Tag
